# 335-Programming-Languages

CSE 335 is about the principles, design and implementation of modern programming languages. 

Generally speaking, syntax, semantics and their intimate interplay in modern programming languages are the major aspects of study in CSE 335.

The general prerequisite for CSE 335: 

CSE 231 & Math 275 and major standing
The major approach we use to study programming languages in CSE 335 is experiment-based. In other words, you will get your hands wet and build an interpreter for a non-trivial programming language. To achieve it within one short semester, we will approach it by studying functional programming paradigm, which allows you to write way-shorter programs to achieve the same objectives with better readability (if you get used to it) and, maintainability (less debugging time).  It is a hot area in comtemporary software engineering communities and,  popular languages like Javascript, Python and Scala, for example, all inherit  this trend.

Course Objectives:

Be able to describe main quality criteria for the design of high level programming languages such as readability, writability etc. 
Be able to describe syntax of fundamental program components
Be able to discuss fundamental concepts of semantics
Be able to describe parameter passing and access to non-locals 
Be able to describe data types and type system
Be able to apply major features of functional programming languages
